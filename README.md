# House-Price-Prediction
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house, our machine learning model must predict the house price.
In this project, I started with the Boston House prices.
In the first model, we used linear reression and the root square mean was low.
In the second project, I worked with the Carlifonia House Prices.
I incorporated more than 1 algorithm for the project,
later on, I tested the accuracy of each and chose the one with the least rsme to get the best model for the project.
